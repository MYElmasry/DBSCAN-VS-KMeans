# DBSCAN-VS-KMeans
##Implement the enhanced DBSCAN on a partitioned dataset
*Provide 2 datasets (1 spherical , 1 non spherical) with a small number of features (2 features) so you can easily visualize it - Apply the following on each of the 2 datasets.
* Apply K-Means on the dataset to partition the dataset into K partitions
* Apply DBSCAN on each partition separately
* Plot the following:
..1. The dataset before any clustering
..2. Result of K-Means clustering
..3. Result of DBSCAN
..4. The dense regions
