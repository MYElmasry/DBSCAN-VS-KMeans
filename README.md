# DBSCAN-VS-KMeans
##Implement the enhanced DBSCAN on a partitioned dataset
●Provide 2 datasets (1 spherical , 1 non spherical) with a small number of features (2 features) so you can easily visualize it - Apply the following on each of the 2 datasets.
● Apply K-Means on the dataset to partition the dataset into K partitions
● Apply DBSCAN on each partition separately
● Plot the following:
  ○ The dataset before any clustering
  ○ Result of K-Means clustering
  ○ Result of DBSCAN
  ○ The dense regions
