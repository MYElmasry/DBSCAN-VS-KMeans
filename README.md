# DBSCAN-VS-KMeans
##Implement the enhanced DBSCAN on a partitioned dataset

1. Provide 2 datasets (1 spherical , 1 non spherical) with a small number of features (2 features) so you can easily visualize it - Apply the following on each of the 2 datasets.
2. Apply K-Means on the dataset to partition the dataset into K partitions
3. Apply DBSCAN on each partition separately
4. Plot the following: (The dataset before any clustering, Result of DBSCAN, The dense regions)
